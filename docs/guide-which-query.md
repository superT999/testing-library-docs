## Priority

Based on [the Guiding Principles](guiding-principles.md), your test should
resemble how users interact with your code (component, page, etc.) as much as
possible. With this in mind, we recommend this order of priority:

1. **Queries Accessible to Everyone** queries that reflect the experience of
   visual/mouse users as well as those that use assistive technology
   1. `getByRole`: This can be used to query every element that is exposed in
      the
      [accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AOM).
      With the `name` option you can filter the returned elements by their
      [accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/). This should be your
      top preference for just about everything. There's not much you can't get
      with this (if you can't, it's possible your UI is inaccessible). Most
      often, this will be used with the `name` option like so:
      `getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i})`. Check the
      [list of roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Roles).
   1. `getByLabelText`: Only really good for form fields, but this is the number
      one method a user finds those elements, so it should be your top
      preference.
   1. `getByPlaceholderText`:
      [A placeholder is not a substitute for a label](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/).
      But if that's all you have, then it's better than alternatives.
   1. `getByText`: Not useful for forms, but this is the number 1 method a user
      finds most non-interactive elements (like divs and spans).
   1. `getByDisplayValue`: The current value of a form element can be useful
      when navigating a page with filled-in values.
1. **Semantic Queries** HTML5 and ARIA compliant selectors. Note that the user
   experience of interacting with these attributes varies greatly across
   browsers and assistive technology.
   1. `getByAltText`: If your element is one which supports `alt` text (`img`,
      `area`, and `input`), then you can use this to find that element.
   1. `getByTitle`: The title attribute is not consistently read by
      screenreaders, and is not visible by default for sighted users
1. **Test IDs**
   1. `getByTestId`: The user cannot see (or hear) these, so this is only
      recommended for cases where you can't match by role or text or it doesn't
      make sense (e.g. the text is dynamic).

## Manual Queries

On top of the queries provided by the testing library, you can use the regular
[`querySelector` DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)
to query elements. Note that using this as an escape hatch to query by class or
id is a bad practice because users can't see or identify these attributes. Use a
testid if you have to.

```jsx
// @testing-library/react
const { container } = render(<MyComponent />)
const foo = container.querySelector('[data-foo="bar"]')
```

## Chrome extension

Do you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries?

There is a very cool Chrome extension named
[Testing Playground](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano/related),
and it helps you find the best queries to select elements. It allows you to
inspect the element hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools, and provides you
with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing
practices.

## Playground

If you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out on
[testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com). Testing Playground is
an interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own
html, and get visual feedback matching the rules mentioned above.
